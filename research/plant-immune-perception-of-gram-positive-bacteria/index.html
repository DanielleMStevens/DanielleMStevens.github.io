<h3 id="plant-innate-immune-systems-perceive-and-elicit-responses-to-limit-pathogens">Plant innate immune systems perceive and elicit responses to limit pathogens.</h3>
<p>Surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can perceive molecular features such as MAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns, and effectors from diverse pathogens. PRR perception induces a variety of responses including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium influx, kinase cascades, defense gene expression, and biosynthesis of plant defense hormones such as salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (Fig. 1–Right). In the tomato-Cm pathosystem, it is possible for plant immunity to be activated and impact disease; applications of a SA-analog decrease bacterial titer and microarray analyses shows up-regulation of ethylene biosynthesis genes during infection. Clavibacter genomes encode for two MAMPs previously found in G- bacteria, the protein epitopes of cold shock protein, csp22, and ribosomal elongation factor, elf18. Both are conserved in sequence to the consensus and are likely immunogenic if released from cells (Fig. 3). Unlike many bacteria, Clavibacter are not flagellated and thus, lack the flagellin epitope. Further investigation of plant responses to G+ pathogens may aid development of robust crops.</p>
<h4 id="21-characterize-immune-elicitation-of-encoded-known-mamps-elf18-and-csp22">2.1 Characterize immune elicitation of encoded known MAMPs elf18 and csp22.</h4>
<p>Plant-associated bacteria possess multiple MAMPs.6 The well-known MAMPs, csp22 and elf18, were identified from 70 Clavibacter genomes with high similarity to canonical epitopes, which will facilitate investigation of the importance of plant defense against G+ plant pathogens (Fig. 3). I have obtained near-isogenic and transgenic tomato seed in M82 and Moneymaker background that can perceive csp22 and elf18, respectively, as well as their controls.44,45 To verify Cm elf18 and csp22 are immunogenic, I will synthesize the peptide MAMPs and scrambled peptide controls, treat respective tomato genotypes, and quantify production of ROS and the expression of the defense gene, PR-1. To assess the difference in response with xylem and apoplastic colonization, I will grow plants and assess bacterial titers using standard inoculation methods after prick (stem) and spray (foliar) inoculation respectively.8,42 I will compare disease symptoms and bacterial titers in genotypes that do and do not carry cognate receptors. If Cm elf18 and csp22 are perceived, then I expected disease and bacterial titer to decrease compared to controls.</p>
<h4 id="22-identify-g-mamps-from-pathogenic-clavibacter-bacteria">2.2 Identify G+ MAMPs from pathogenic Clavibacter bacteria.</h4>
<p>Genes that encode MAMPs display signatures of overall negative selection with small regions of very high positive selection (the immunogenic region). Multiple novel MAMPs have been discovered in G- pathogens using selection patterns.46,47 This method also predicted hypothesized MAMPs in G+ actinobacteria Rhodococcus.5 To predict novel G+ MAMPs in Clavibacter, I will use Get_Homologs to identify core genes shared. An initial ka/ks test will identify genes under overall negative selection and then a scanning-window approach will be used to filter genes that carry short regions of high positive selection.46 Additionally, Tajima’s D will be used to cross compare for core genes that are not under neutral selection.39 In total, I will functionally validate 10-15 candidate MAMPs.</p>
<h4 id="23-investigate-the-importance-of-inducible-plant-defenses">2.3 Investigate the importance of inducible plant defenses.</h4>
<p>Candidate G+ MAMP peptides will be synthesized and tested for elicitation of an immune response in hosts and nonhosts from diverse plant families given the broad host range of Clavibacter. This includes the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae family) and Nicotiana benthamiana (Solanaceae family), the crops tomato Solanum lycopersicum cultivar Rio Grande (Solanaceae family) and corn Zea mays (Poaceae family), and diverse varieties of citrus (Rutaceae family). I will measure the production of ROS and ethylene, a plant defense hormone known to be induced in the Cm-tomato pathosystem.29 Water treated mock plants will be used as controls. Any promising MAMPs will be further examined with a scrambled peptide control. Eight technical replicates with a minimum of three biological replicates will be analyzed and significance will be determined using a one-way ANOVA and a Tukey’s post means comparison test.</p>

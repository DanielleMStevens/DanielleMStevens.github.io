      <description>With the decreasing costs of sequencing genomes, comparative genomics is reaching a new era where hundreds to potentially thousadnds of microbes can be sequenced at once. This provides incredible power to formuate hypothesize about the functional contribution of bacterial loci to a biological process. This work uses these emerging technologies to develop a robust genomic dataset and enable hypothesis generation of functional contribution of bacterial loci to particular biological processes, such as effector drive host range.</description>

      <description>While the plants arounds are always seemingly healthy, plants can get sick too. To combate this, they have developed innate immune systems to try to preceive when a potential pathogen attack is nearby and respond accordingly to limit disease development. This has been studied extensively in many micorbes except for Gram-positive actinobacterial pathogens. This work focuses to characterize the potential for immmune preception and resoponse to these pathogens.</description>
